# TypeSpeed

The aim of this game is to test how fast you can type words. You have one minute to type correctly as many words as you can. Press space to skip or to get the next word. You get 1 point for each correct words and 2 point if the length of the word is more than 10 characters. The game will count the correctly pressed keys as well so your speed will be determined by the correctly pressed keys. At the end of the game you will receive your results and get a badge depending on your typing qualification. If you feel a word too difficult just skip it by pressing space! If you choose hard level then you can skip the word only if you typed correctly at least the first half of it, if extreme level than the actual word will be visible only for a really short time.
